# FEHSimulation
By Ethan Dettmann (2023)

Fire Emblem Heroes is a mobile game released by Nintendo/Intelligent Systems on February 2nd, 2017. 
Using a variety of characters from the Fire Emblem series, players can strategize how to beat difficult challenges
presented in both PVP and PVE forms. Lots of systems are at play that causes the playerbase to forever strategize.

I wish to make my own simulation of the game. Not just in combat, but also the field, allowing for greater control
over testing FEH's unit's and skills. The final product will allow users to test over thousands of simulations for
optimal teams to use in modes such as Arena or Aether Raids.

I am but a college student with this being a passion project, so this will be in progress for a while.
